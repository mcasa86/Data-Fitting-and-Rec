% Description: we aim to implement a tool for computing the integrals
%
%  b_r = int_[a,b] f (x)H_r(x) dx and G_rc = int_[a,b] H_r(x)H_c(x) dx
%
% for r,c = 1,2,...,#of knots in [a,b]. We discussed in class how impractical
% and uncommon is to compute these integrals analytically and chosen instead to
% employ some quadrature formula.
%
% In this code
% A. we start by setting up a quadrature routine;
% B. we compute b_r ang G_rc in an element-to-element fashion using quadrature (*);
% C. we refine the assembly to make the code more easily generalisable.
%
% (*) that's called "assembly".
%

%
% Funny things we could be doing next (start thinking about it at home):
%
% 1. produce L_2[f](x) for an f defined on a linear subspace of R^2 (not R)
% 2. produce L_2[f](x) for an f defined on a curve in R^2
% 3. compute the L_2 norm of L_2[f](x)
% 4. compute the L_2 norm of f(x) (you need pull-back/push-forward operators)
% 5. L_2[f](x) interpolation in 2D/3D!
